[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/snaplet-persistent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/snaplet-persistent)

This package makes it easier to integrate your snap applications with databases
using persistent. It also includes a backend for the auth snaplet defining how
users should be stored in your database.

Adding the snaplet to your application is simply a matter of adding the snaplet
to your applicationâ€™s state data type and initializing it appropriately in your
application initializer. After you do this, when you run your application for
the first time, the snaplet will automatically install a default configuration
file that looks like this.

postgre-con-str = "host='localhost' dbname='snap-test' user='guest' password='password1'"
postgre-pool-size = 3

Then you can edit this file as you see fit. The auth backend works similarly
with its own set of config options.
